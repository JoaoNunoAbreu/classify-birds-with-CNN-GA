# Convolutional Neural Networks on Image Classification

Classify the bird species that appear on an image.

## How it's done:

- Preparation and analysis of dataset;
- Training and validation of learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN);
- Use of Genetic Algorithms (GA) for learning model hyper parameter optimization, structure optimization and loss function optimization.
